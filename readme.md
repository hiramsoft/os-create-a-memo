One-Step Create-A-Memo
======================

This project is a reaction to front page Hacker News Story [Show HN: My first web app - PDF memo creator](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12843466).

Different than that project, this one is open source and runs 100% in your modern browser for privacy.

See the about.html for a background and motivation behind this project.

Contributing
============

I generally don't check GitHub, so most contributions -- while welcome -- will be missed.  Please fork away!

How to Develop
============

This project uses webpack 2.  Please ensure you have it installed.

To run a dev server with hot-reloading (alias for webpack-dev-server)

>  yarn run dev

To build the dist folder

>  yarn run dist


Code Quality
============

This is an MVP whose timebox was set to 4 hours, 2 of which were spent reading and writing docs.
